#- Augment for command_not_found_handler function.
# This tool digests a named array called COMMAND_TYPOS.
# Its primary function is to intercept command typos, including those with spaces.
# Because of this, it also creates the ability to define command aliases with spaces (eg. 'l s-l'='ls -l').

#     Command must not exist to be used as an alias, including any cmd_alias with spaces (commands up to the first space).
